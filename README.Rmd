## Principle of PRISM

![PRISM](Github_Fig.png)
[PRISM](https://github.com/martintnr/PRISM) takes as input GWAS summary statistics of multiple traits and outputs significant labeled variant-trait effects. Further information can be found in our [pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.01.24308193).

## Results visualization

You can visualize PRISM results and the causal network of any variant on our [Shiny visualization tool](https://verbam01.shinyapps.io/PRISM/). The app can be launched locally from R using the following command:
```{r lshiny, eval = FALSE}

shiny::runGitHub(repo = "martintnr/PRISMApp", subdir = "")

```
